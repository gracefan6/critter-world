# critter-world


This project creates a simulation of a world of bugs called Critters that can move around, turn, eat, food, grow, serve, attack one another, bud, and mate using Java, JavaFx, and Gradle. This program was written as the final project of CS 2112 (fall 2020). Due to academic intergrity concerns, I am unable to publicly publish the full repository of thie project. I, instead, posted a jar file of the project. To view the full contents of the code, please email fan123.me@gmail.com for requests.
